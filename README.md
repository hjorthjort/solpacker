Simple utility for helping you reduce your storage layout costs.
Optimal layout is NP-hard, but "first fit" is an algorithm that works well enough in general.
The goal is simply to quickly identify optimizations and suggest them.

This is just a proof of concept.
Ideally this should be part of solc.
